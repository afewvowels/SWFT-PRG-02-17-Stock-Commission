//  Kathryn bought 750 shares of stock at a price of $35.00 per share. She must pay her

//  and displays the following:
//  *The amount paid for the stock alone (without the commission)
//  *The amount for the commission
//  *The total amount paid (for the stock plus the commission)

import Foundation

// Declare constants
let stockShares = 750

// Declare variables
var stockAlone: Double
var commissionPrice: Double
var stockTotalCost: Double

// Calculate values, cast ints to doubles
stockAlone = Double(stockShares) * Double(stockPrice)

// Format calculated values for dollar output
